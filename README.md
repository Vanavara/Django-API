# Django-API Portfolio

## In this project the work was divided into 3 stages.

At the first stage, I created a database, developed a class for working with the database and one method for the REST API.
To protect data, an environment called .env was created.
Sensitive info is stored in this folder, Here is the description of secret onfo.
FSTR_DB_HOST: database path;
FSTR_DB_PORT: database port;
FSTR_DB_LOGIN: login used to connect to the database;
FSTR_DB_PASS: password used to connect to the database.

During the second step, I made three more methods for the Rest API.

In the third period, I covered the code with tests and prepared Readme.
A test has been launched to check the entered user data information. Tests were implemented (file tests).
